### WEEK1 ###

Common problem types:
- Making predictions: using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future
> A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.

- Categorizing things: assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features
> An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.

- Spotting something unusual: identifying data that is different from the norm
> A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.

- Identifying themes: grouping categorized information into broader concepts
> User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes.

- Discovering connections: finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them
> A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries.

- Finding patterns: using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again
> Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window. 

**Specific Measurable Action-oriented Relevan Time-bound question**
- Specific questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.
- Measuralbe questions can be quantified and assessed.
- Action-oriented questions encourage change.
- Relevant questions matter, are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve.
- Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied.

Data-inspired decision-making: explores different data sources to find out what they have in common

Quantitative Data: specific and objective measures of numerical facts (what? how many? how often?)
Qualitative Data: subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics (why? how?)

Big Data:
- Volume: the amount of data
- Variety: the different kinds of data
- Velocity: how fast the data can be processed
- Veracity: the quality and reliability of the data
