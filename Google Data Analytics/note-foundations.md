> If you want to make a few important decisions under uncertainty, that is Statistics.

> If you want to automate, in other words, make many many decisions under uncertainty, that is machine learning and AI.

> If you don't know how much decisions you want to make before you begin, or if what you're looking for is inspiration, or you want to encounter your unknown unknowns. You want to understand your world. That is analytics.

Data Ecosystems: the various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data

Cloud: a place to keep data online, rather than a computer hard drive

Data Science: creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data

Data-Driven Decision-Making: using facts to guide business strategy

~~Gut Instinct sometimes can be a problem.~~ Blending data(facts) with business knowledg(gut instinct).



### WEEK2 ###

Analytical Skills: qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts
**curiosity, understanding context, having a technical mindset, data design, and data strategy**
 - context is the condition in which something exists or happens
 - technical mindset is the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way
 - data design is how you organize information
 - data strategy is the management of the people, processes and tools used in data analysis

Analytical Thinking: identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner
**visualization, strategy, problem-orientation, correlation, and big-picture and detail-oriented thinking**
 - visualization is the graphical representation of information
 - correlation does not equal causation
 
Root Cause: the reason why a problem occurs
 
Gap Analysis: a method for examining and evaluation how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future



### WEEK3 ###

**Data Life Cycle: plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive and destroy**
- Plan: decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it
- Capture: collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources
- Manage: care for and maintain the data, including determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so
- Analyze: use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals
- Archive: keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference
- destroy: remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data

Database: a collection of data stored in a computer system

Stakeholders: people who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome
- look at the current state and identify how it's different from the ideal state
- determine who the stakeholders are

**Data analyst tools: spreadsheets, query languages and visualization tools**

the two popular spreadsheets are Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets
- collect, store, organize, and sort information
- identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project
- create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts

Formula: a set of instructions that performs a specific action using the data in a spreadsheet

Function: a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet

Query Language: a computer programming language that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data from a database (SQL: structured query language)
- allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)
- make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases
- allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis

Data Visualization: the graphical representation of information (Tableau & Looker)
- turn complex numbers into a story that people can understand
- help stakeholders come up with conclusions that lead to informed decisions and effective business strategies

### WEEK4 ###

Attribute: a characteristic or quality of data used to label a column in a table

Observation: all of the attributes for something contained in a row of a data table

Basic SQL query:
(AS means aliases, such as "field1 AS name", then you can use "SELECT name" instead of "SELECT field1")
- SELECT: choose the columns you want to return
(SELECT * means select all columns)
- FROM: choose the tables where the columns you want are located
- WHERE: filter for certain information
(LIKE in WHERE allows you to tell the database to look for a certain pattern, such as "WHERE field1 LIKE 'CH%')
(<> means does not equal)
(comments can be like "/* comments */" or "-- comments")

> A data visualization is the graphical representation of information.

> A pie chart shows how a whole is broken down into parts
