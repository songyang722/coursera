### WEEK1 ###

Information Technology: the use of digital technology, like computers and the Internet, to store and process data into useful information

Computer: a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations

Algorithm: a series of steps that solve specific problems

Linux: a widely used open source operating system

Binary System: the communication that a computer uses, also known as a base-2 numberal system

Bit: a binary digit

Byte: a group of 8 bits, each byte can store one character and we can have 256 possible values thanks to the base-2 system(2^8)

Character Encoding: assigns our binary values to characters, so that we as humans can read them

ASCII: represents the English alphabet, digits, and punctuation marks [ASCII](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html)

UTF-8: built off the Unicode Standard
RGB(Red,Green,Blue)

Logic Gates: allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions

Abstraction: to take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use

Copmupter Layers
- hardware: made up of the physical components of a computer
- operating system: allows hardware to communicate with the system
- software: how we as humans interact with our computer
- users: interacts with the computer

> MB is megabyte or unit of data storage, while Mb/s is a megabit per second, which is a unit of ata transfer rate.

> Remember that 1byte is 8 bits, so to transfer a 1MB file in a second, you need an 8 MB/s connection speed.

Ports: connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer

CPU (Central Processing Unit): the brain of computer, it does all the calculations and data processing
- there are two major types of CPU: LGA (Land Grid Array) and PGA (Pin Grid Array)
- an LGA socket has pins coming out of the motherboard
- a PGA socket has pins coming out of the processor itself

RAM (Random Access Memory): computer's short-term memory (once we power off our machines, the data stored in RAM is cleared) 
- the one type of RAM that's commonly found in computers is DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory)
- there are also different types of memory sticks that DRAM chips can be put on, the more modern DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module) sticks have different sizes of pins on them
- in today's system, we use another type of RAM, called DDR or DDR SDRAM (double data rate SDRAM)

Hard Drive: holds all of our data, which includes all of our music, pictures, applications
- there are two types: HDDs (Hard Describes) more affordable but more prone to damage; SSDs (Solid State Drive) less risky losing data but more expensive
- RPM (revolution per minute)

Motherboard: the body or circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together
- the chipset is a key component of our motherboard that allows us to manage data between out CPU, RAM, and peripherals
- Northbridge: chip set that interconnects RAM and video cards
- Southbridge: chip set that maintains input/output (IO) controllers

Peripherals: external devices we connect to our computer, like a mouse, keyboard, and monitor

Expansion Slots: give us the ability to increase the functionality of our computer
- the standard for an expansion bus today is the PCI Express (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)
- a PCIe bus looks like a slot on the motherboard and a PCIe base expansion card looks like a smallest circuit board

Form Factor: determines the amount we can put in and the amount of space we'll have
- the most common form factor for matherboards is ATX (Advanced Technology Extended)

Programs: instructions that tell the computer what to do

EDB (External Data Bus): a row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer

MCC (Memory Controller Chip): a bridge between the CPU and the RAM

Cache: smaller that RAM but store data that use often and quickly reference it, there are 3 different cache levels in a CPU: L1, L2, and L3, L1 is the smallest and fastest cache

Clock Speed: the maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle in a certain time period

Power Supplies: power the motherboard
- DC (Direct Current) or AC (Alternating Current)
- voltage (same as pressure in water)
- wattage: the amount of volts and amps that a device needs

System on a Chip (SoC): packs the CPU, RAM, and sometimes even the storage onto a single chip

Peripherals: anything that you connect to your computer externally that adds functionality

DVI cables are generally just output video.
HDMI has become a standard in lots of televisions and computers nowadays and output both video and audio.

> USB connectors are the most common connector type and they transfer data and power to devices connected to a computer.

> Communication connectors, such as RJ-45 and fiber optic cables, connect devices to the internet and one another.

> IT professionals may encounter legacy devices that use older connectors such as DB89 and Molex.

> Punch down blocks are terminal strips used to connect telephone or data lines.
