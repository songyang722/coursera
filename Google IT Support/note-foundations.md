### WEEK1 ###

Information Technology: the use of digital technology, like computers and the Internet, to store and process data into useful information

Computer: a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations

Algorithm: a series of steps that solve specific problems

Linux: a widely used open source operating system

Binary System: the communication that a computer uses, also known as a base-2 numberal system

Bit: a binary digit

Byte: a group of 8 bits, each byte can store one character and we can have 256 possible values thanks to the base-2 system(2^8)

Character Encoding: assigns our binary values to characters, so that we as humans can read them

ASCII: represents the English alphabet, digits, and punctuation marks [ASCII](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html)

UTF-8: built off the Unicode Standard
RGB(Red,Green,Blue)

Logic Gates: allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions

Abstraction: to take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use

Copmupter Layers
- hardware: made up of the physical components of a computer
- operating system: allows hardware to communicate with the system
- software: how we as humans interact with our computer
- users: interacts with the computer



### WEEK2 ###

Ports: connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer

CPU (Central Processing Unit): the brain of computer, it does all the calculations and data processing
- there are two major types of CPU: LGA (Land Grid Array) and PGA (Pin Grid Array)
- an LGA socket has pins coming out of the motherboard
- a PGA socket has pins coming out of the processor itself

RAM (Random Access Memory): computer's short-term memory (once we power off our machines, the data stored in RAM is cleared)

Hard Drive: holds all of our data, which includes all of our music, pictures, applications

Motherboard: the body or circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together

Programs: instructions that tell the computer what to do

EDB (External Data Bus): a row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer

MCC (Memory Controller Chip): a bridge between the CPU and the RAM

Cache: smaller that RAM but store data that use often and quickly reference it, there are 3 different cache levels in a CPU: L1, L2, and L3, L1 is the smallest and fastest cache

Clock Speed: the maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle in a certain time period
