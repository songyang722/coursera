### WEEK1 ###

Information Technology: the use of digital technology, like computers and the Internet, to store and process data into useful information

Computer: a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations

Algorithm: a series of steps that solve specific problems

Linux: a widely used open source operating system

Binary System: the communication that a computer uses, also known as a base-2 numberal system

Bit: a binary digit

Byte: a group of 8 bits, each byte can store one character and we can have 256 possible values thanks to the base-2 system(2^8)

Character Encoding: assigns our binary values to characters, so that we as humans can read them

ASCII: represents the English alphabet, digits, and punctuation marks [ASCII](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html)

UTF-8: built off the Unicode Standard
RGB(Red,Green,Blue)

Logic Gates: allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions

Abstraction: to take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use

Copmupter Layers
- hardware: made up of the physical components of a computer
- operating system: allows hardware to communicate with the system
- software: how we as humans interact with our computer
- users: interacts with the computer
